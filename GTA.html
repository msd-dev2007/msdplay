  Five years ago, Carl Johnson sought refuge from the tumultuous life in Los Santos, San Andreas, a city gripped by gang conflicts, drugs, and corruption. Amidst this chaos, even the rich and famous couldn't escape the shadow of dealers and gangbangers.<br><br>

Fast forward to the early 90s, and Carl is compelled to return to his hometown. His mother has tragically been murdered, his family lies in disarray, and his childhood friends are spiraling toward disaster. <br><br>

Upon his homecoming, a pair of corrupt cops unjustly pin a murder on him. Now, CJ is thrust into a harrowing journey that spans the entire expanse of San Andreas, all in a bid to rescue his family and reclaim control of the streets.<br><br>

Rockstar Games delivers its most ambitious mobile release to date, offering a sprawling open-world that encompasses the entirety of the San Andreas state, including the bustling cities of Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas. Players can expect enhanced visuals and an immersive experience, with over 70 hours of gameplay awaiting them in this epic adventure.
